STORAGE RULES UPDATE NEEDED:

The Firebase Storage rules need to be deployed manually since CLI authentication is not available in this environment.

Current storage.rules content:
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow all users to read and write any file for development
    // This matches the working setup before Firebase credential changes
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

Manual steps to deploy:
1. Go to Firebase Console > Storage > Rules
2. Replace the existing rules with the content above
3. Click "Publish"
