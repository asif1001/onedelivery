# Deployment Issue Fix

## Problem Found
Your application builds correctly, but the deployment shows Firebase's default setup page because:
1. Your latest commit is not pushed to GitHub (`HEAD` is ahead of `origin/main`)
2. GitHub Actions only deploys when changes are pushed to the main branch
3. Your Firebase hosting is correctly configured to serve from `dist/public`

## Quick Fix - Push Your Changes

Run these commands in your Replit shell to push your changes and trigger deployment:

```bash
# Push your latest commit to GitHub
git push origin main

# Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Actions to complete
# Then check your deployed site
```

## Alternative: Manual Firebase Deploy

If you want to deploy directly from Replit without GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI globally (one-time setup)
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase (you'll need to authenticate)
firebase login

# Deploy directly
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Verify Your Site

After deployment, your site should show your oil delivery application instead of the Firebase setup page.

- Live URL: https://oneplace-b5fc3.web.app
- GitHub Actions Status: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions

## Files Are Ready
✅ Application builds successfully (`dist/public` contains your app)
✅ Firebase configuration is correct (`firebase.json` points to right directory)
✅ GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured
✅ All environment variables are set in GitHub secrets

The only missing piece is pushing your latest commit to GitHub!
